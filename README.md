## Chatbot

This project consists of creating a chatbot using the following tools:

* Streamlit
* Langchain
* OpeanAI API (free tier)

### Streamlit

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science. It's designed to be easy to use for anyone with basic Python knowledge, without requiring prior experience with web development or front-end frameworks.

In this case, we are going to use Streamlit to create the chatbot interface.


### LangChain

LangChain is an open-source Python framework designed to simplify the development of applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It provides a modular and declarative approach to building applications that leverage LLMs for various purposes.

### OpenAI API

For this project, we are using the OpenAI API (free tier). In this case, we can obtain the API key visiting [this](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) page.
